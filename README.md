Problem Chosen: Mars Rovers

Created classes for the Rover and Plateau to store properties and data. The properties are private for the Rover for the moment. Those properties can be changed to public later on if requirements change. Modifying these properties prevents modifying the private class variables directly. It is assumed the Rover will land at coordinates (1,2) heading N for now but should requirements change, we can change the SetRoverLandingPoint method to give extra functionality. The most common errors I can think of should be caught by the error catching for each user input prompt. Some extra user input prompts were added to make the console app more user friendly when compared to the output in the PDF that lists all the Mars Rover problem.
